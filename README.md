# ADS_citibike_project


Notes for CUSP: If running python scripts on compute, the standard python will not work because geopandas is not available.
Instead, use: /opt/rh/anaconda/root/envs/PUI2016_Python2/bin/python


## Programs:

1) setup_01: prepares working directory and downloads data

2) geopandas_testing.py: this will hopefully become our program for merging datasets together. it has this bad name beacuse I was messing around with plots for a little while as well (since removed).
